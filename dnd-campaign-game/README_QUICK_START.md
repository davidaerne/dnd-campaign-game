# D&D Campaign Game - Quick Start

## System Overview

Your D&D campaign game foundation is now set up! Here's what's included:

### ✅ Features Working
- Campaign selection screen
- Split-screen layout (Party | Scene | Interactions)  
- Scene rendering with interactive elements
- Campaign state management with Zustand
- TypeScript type safety throughout
- Framer Motion animations
- Responsive D&D-themed UI

### 🚧 Currently Showing
Since you don't have assets yet, the system will:
- Display campaign cards for selection
- Show scene titles and descriptions
- Render interactive markers (NPCs, encounters, transitions)
- Handle scene transitions via clicks
- Maintain game state and progress

### 🖼️ Missing Assets (Expected locations)

```

### 🎮 How to Test

1. **Start the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test the campaign flow:**
   - Select "The Missing Merchant" campaign
   - Click through scenes using the green transition portals (→)
   - Try clicking NPCs and encounter markers (!)
   - Use the "Back to Campaigns" button to return

3. **Check the console** for interaction logs when clicking elements

### 🎨 Next Steps
1. Generate images using the provided ChatGPT prompts
2. Add images to the appropriate asset folders
3. Test with real visuals
4. Move to utility development phase

### 🔧 Architecture Notes
- `src/stores/campaignStore.ts` - State management
- `src/types/` - TypeScript interfaces  
- `src/components/campaign/` - Core campaign components
- `public/data/campaigns/` - JSON campaign definitions

The system is designed to be scalable - just add more JSON campaigns and asset folders!
